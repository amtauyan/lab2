<p><strong>Hobbies/Interests:</strong> I play games during my free time, but if I am lazy to move my fingers that much in such a game, I rather dance or like read books.

<h2>Subject Related Questions</h2>
<p><strong>What do you expect to learn from this course (Web Programming)?</strong> From the word itself, Web, which can mean website and programming. I expect that I’m about to learn HTML and CSS, but I think there are more languages to expect just than these two</p>
<p><strong>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major?</strong> I really want to learn different languages and also be fluent in some of those programming languages. I also want to learn the importance or like the fun with it, for me to have more motivation to learn it</p>

<h2>Life Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Goals in life. What do you wish to accomplish in your life?</strong> To be honest, I still do not have a goal in life because I am still undecided on which track of Information Technology should I take.

<p><strong>Do you have a dream that you wish to fulfill? If yes, what is you dream?</strong> I have this dream that I could get to have my own dream house where all my friends and family will hangout. It could be a vacation place, something like that.

<p><strong>Any other interesting aspects of your life that you would like to share?</strong> There is nothing much interesting in my life, but I would like to add that I am the kind of person that puts in every thing and in every important person in my life. I am the kind of person that treats people the way they deserve. I also love to take sunset photos or sky photos</p>
